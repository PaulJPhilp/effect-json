- Tagged error system (ParseError, ValidationError, StringifyError)
- Pluggable backend architecture

✅ **Quality Metrics**
- 84 tests with 85.62% coverage
- TypeScript strict mode
- Multi-platform CI/CD (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Automated releases via GitHub Actions
- Zero linting errors
- Full Effect best practices compliance

✅ **Documentation**
- Comprehensive README with examples
- API documentation with JSDoc
- Security policy
- Contributing guidelines
- Issue and PR templates

✅ **Infrastructure**
- Published to npm
- GitHub repository with full CI/CD
- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Security scanning (CodeQL)
- Coverage reporting (Codecov ready)

## Differences from Planning

Minor differences between planning documents and final implementation:

1. **Testing Framework**: Used Vitest instead of the originally planned framework
   - Reason: Better Bun integration and performance
   - Impact: None, all testing requirements met

2. **Build Tool**: Used Vite instead of custom bundling
   - Reason: Better TypeScript declaration generation
   - Impact: Improved developer experience

3. **Coverage Target**: Achieved 85.62% vs. planned 90%
   - Reason: Some error paths difficult to test (e.g., superjson loading edge cases)
   - Impact: Minimal, all critical paths covered

All core requirements and features from the planning documents were successfully delivered.

## Future Roadmap

Potential enhancements for future versions (see GitHub Issues):

- Additional backends (YAML, TOML, etc.)
- Schema inference from JSON samples
- Custom error formatters
- Streaming JSON support
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced TypeScript inference
