bun install

# Run tests
bun test                    # Run all tests
bun run test:watch          # Watch mode
bun run test:coverage       # With coverage

# Linting and formatting

bun run lint               # Lint only

# Type checking
bun run typecheck

# Build
bun run build

# Clean
bun run clean
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `src/__tests__/`
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Aim for >85% code coverage
- Use Effect's testing utilities

Example test:

```typescript
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect";
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import * as Json from "../index.js";

describe("MyFeature", () => {
  it("should do something", async () => {
    const schema = Schema.Struct({ id: Schema.Number });
    const result = await Effect.runPromise(
      Json.parse(schema, '{"id": 1}')
    );
    expect(result).toEqual({ id: 1 });
  });
});
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Effect best practices
- Use Effect.gen for composing effects
- Use tagged errors for error handling
- Write JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer immutability

### Documentation

When adding new features:

1. Update JSDoc comments in source code
2. Add examples to README if applicable
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Consider adding to ARCHITECTURE.md for significant changes

## Release Process

Releases are automated through GitHub Actions:

1. Update version in `packages/effect-json/package.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes
3. Commit changes
4. Create and push a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```
5. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Run all tests
   - Build the package
   - Publish to npm
   - Create a GitHub release
